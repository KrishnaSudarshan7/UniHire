# UniHire - Faculty hiring platform for universities

UniHire is a simple yet effective android application provided to users where applicants can apply for a teaching job or recruiters can post new job openings. Applicants will be able to search for teaching jobs specifically in one place. They can effectively search for Departments, Specialization etc. Unlike other portals where accountants, consultants, and Software Engineers use the same portal, we provide a separate platform for teaching jobs.
